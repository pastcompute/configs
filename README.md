configs

Personal configuration file.

Nothing to see here, but perhaps someone struggling to setup OpenBox might find it useful.

Nothing private or security related either; the only thing pushed in .ssh/ is a fairly nondescript config, no private keys! (Duh)

(So dont get excited about seeing a .ssh directory)
